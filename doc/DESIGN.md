# SMeCoL design

The basics behind SMeCoL are that sending arbitrary binary messages between devices is handy.

Not having to deal with the transport, the ensurances of uncorrupted data or anything of the sort decreases the necessary effort to implement bidirectional communication by a lot.

Whether a few small MCU's attached to a CAN bus or powerful x86_64 machines passing messages via TCP.
